<h1>Explain the Difference Between var, let, and const</h1>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>
    <b>var</b>, <b>let</b>, and <b>const</b> are JavaScript keywords used to declare variables.
    They mainly differ in scope, reassignment/redeclaration, and hoisting behavior.
</p>

<h2>1. Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>var</b> is function-scoped (or global if declared outside a function).</li>
    <li><b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are block-scoped, meaning they are limited to <b>{ }</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Reassignment and Redeclaration</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>var</b> → Can be reassigned and redeclared.</li>
    <li><b>let</b> → Can be reassigned, but cannot be redeclared in the same scope.</li>
    <li><b>const</b> → Cannot be reassigned or redeclared.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> For objects and arrays declared with <b>const</b>, their properties can still be modified.
</p>

<h2>3. Hoisting and Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>var</b> → Hoisted and initialized with <b>undefined</b>, so it can be accessed before declaration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> → Hoisted but not initialized and remain in the
        <b>Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)</b> until declared.
        Accessing them early causes a <b>ReferenceError</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Use Which</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>const</b> (default choice): Use when the variable should not be reassigned.</li>
    <li><b>let</b>: Use when reassignment is required, such as loop counters.</li>
    <li>
        <b>var</b>: Avoid in modern JavaScript because function scoping and hoisting can cause bugs;
        use only for legacy code.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>🎯 One-Line Interview Summary</h2>
<p>
    <b>
        var is function-scoped and hoisted with undefined,
        while let and const are block-scoped, hoisted into the TDZ,
        and are safer for modern JavaScript.
