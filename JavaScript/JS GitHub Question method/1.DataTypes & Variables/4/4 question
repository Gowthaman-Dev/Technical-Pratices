"what-are-the-differences-between-variables-created-using-let-var-or-const"

The main differences between variables created with var, let, and const in JavaScript lie in their scope, hoisting behavior, and whether they can be reassigned or re-declared.  

| Feature | var | let | const |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| Scope | Function/Global scoped | Block scoped | Block scoped |
| Reassignment | Yes | Yes | No (for the variable reference) |
| Re-declaration | Yes | No | No |
| Hoisting | Hoisted and initialized with undefined | Hoisted but not initialized | Hoisted but not initialized |
| Temporal Dead Zone | No | Yes | Yes |


Detailed Differences 

• Scope: 

	•  var is function-scoped or globally-scoped. This means a variable declared inside a block (like an if statement or for loop) with var is accessible outside that block if it's within the same function or global scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior. 
	•  let and const are block-scoped. They are only accessible within the specific block (the curly braces {}) where they are defined, which makes code more predictable

• Reassignment: 

	•  var and let variables can have their values changed after they are declared
	•  const variables cannot be reassigned after their initial value is set. However, if a const variable holds an object or an array, the properties or elements of that object/array can still be modified (mutated), but the variable itself cannot be pointed to a new object or array entirely

• Re-declaration: 

	•  var allows you to re-declare the same variable within the same scope without an error, which can cause accidental overwriting of values. 
	•  let and const do not allow re-declaration within the same scope, throwing a SyntaxError and preventing potential bugs. 

• Hoisting and Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): 

	• Hoisting is the JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. 
	• var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and automatically initialized with the value undefined. This means you can access a var variable before it's explicitly declared in the code, and you will get undefined instead of an error. 
	• let and const are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. Attempting to access them before the declaration line results in a ReferenceError because they are in a "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ) until the declaration is processed

Modern Best Practices
In modern JavaScript, it is generally recommended to avoid var due to its confusing scoping rules and potential for bugs. 
Use const by default for any value that should not change.
Use let only when you know the variable's value will need to be reassigned later (e.g., in a for loop counter).
