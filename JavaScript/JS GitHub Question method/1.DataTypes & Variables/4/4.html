<h1>What Are the Differences Between Variables Created Using var, let, and const?</h1>

<p>
    The main differences between <b>var</b>, <b>let</b>, and <b>const</b> in JavaScript
    are related to <b>scope</b>, <b>reassignment & redeclaration</b>, and
    <b>hoisting behavior</b>.

<h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>

<h3>1. Scope</h3>
<p>
    <b>var</b> is function-scoped (or global).
    A variable declared inside a block like <b>if</b> or <b>for</b> is still accessible
    outside the block within the same function.
</p>

<p>
    <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible
    within <b>{ }</b>, which makes code more predictable and safer.
</p>

<h3>2. Reassignment</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>var</b> and <b>let</b> allow reassignment.</li>
    <li><b>const</b> does not allow reassignment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Note: Objects and arrays declared with <b>const</b> can be mutated,
    but the reference itself cannot change.
</p>

<h3>3. Redeclaration</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>var</b> allows redeclaration in the same scope, which can lead to bugs.</li>
    <li><b>let</b> and <b>const</b> do not allow redeclaration and throw a <b>SyntaxError</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Hoisting and Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)</h3>
<p>
    Hoisting moves declarations to the top during the compilation phase.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>var</b> is hoisted and initialized with <b>undefined</b>,
        so it can be accessed before declaration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are hoisted but not initialized and stay in the
        <b>Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)</b> until declared.
        Accessing them early causes a <b>ReferenceError</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Modern Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid <b>var</b> in modern JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Use <b>const</b> by default for values that do not change.</li>
    <li>Use <b>let</b> only when reassignment is required (e.g., loop counters).</li>
</ul>

<h2>🎯 One-Line Interview Answer</h2>
<p>
    <b>
        var is function-scoped and hoisted with undefined,
        while let and const are block-scoped, hoisted into the TDZ,
        and are safer choices for modern JavaScript.
