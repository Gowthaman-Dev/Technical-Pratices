What is the spread operator and how is it used?


English:
“The spread operator in JavaScript is written as three dots (...) and is used to expand elements of an array or object into individual values.
It is commonly used to copy arrays or objects, merge multiple arrays or objects, and pass array elements as arguments to functions.
It helps write cleaner and more readable code compared to traditional methods.”

🟡 If interviewer asks “Can you give an example?”

Give ONE short example only:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const copy = [...arr];

🟡 If interviewer asks “What about functions?”

Say one line:

“It can be used to pass array values as individual arguments to a function.”
