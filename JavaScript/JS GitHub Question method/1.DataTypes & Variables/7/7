What are template literals and how are they used?

English:
“Template literals are a JavaScript ES6 feature used to create strings using backticks instead of quotes.
They allow string interpolation using ${} to embed variables or expressions directly inside a string.
They also support multi-line strings without using \n, which makes the code cleaner and more readable compared to string concatenation.”


🟡 If interviewer asks “How do you use them?”

const name = "Alice";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);


🟡 If interviewer asks “Any advanced feature?”

Say only one line:

“Template literals also support tagged templates, which allow a function to process the string.”

(No need to explain unless asked.)
