1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is widely use to create interactive effects within web browsers. A high-level programming language is a human-understandable language. it is commonly used for developing both web and mobile applications.


i)Define JS in one line ?

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to make web pages interactive.


ii)Difference between JS and other programming languages?	

 JavaScript mostly runs in browsers, so it works on the client-side. Other languages like Java or C usually run on servers and need to be compiled first.

JS is loosely typed, which means you can change a variable’s type while the program is running.

Also, JS supports event-driven and functional programming, so it’s flexible. Some other languages are strictly object-oriented, so everything has to be inside objects.

*Event-driven = Code runs only when an event happens.
*functional programming =Code focuses on using functions to process data.
*Strictly object-oriented programming (OOP) =	Everything must belong to a class or object.





2.=>variables ?

i)Difference between var, let, const.?

*var → function scope, reassign & redeclare செய்யலாம், hoisting-ஆகும்.

*let → block scope, reassign செய்யலாம், redeclare செய்ய முடியாது.

*const → block scope, reassign முடியாது, redeclare முடியாது.


ii)Can you reassign a const variable?

Can you reassign a const variable?
No, const variables cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. However, if the const holds an object or array, its properties/elements can be changed.

expamle:    
const arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4); // ✅ Works, array content changes





3.=>Keywords ?

i)Name some reserved keywords in JS.?

*Keywords are words that JavaScript has reserved for its language syntax. You cannot use these as variable names.

*Common Reserved Keywords:
break, case, catch, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do,
else, export, extends, finally, for, function, if, import, in, instanceof,
let, new, return, super, switch, this, throw, try, typeof, var, void, while, with, yield

*Tip: ES6+ added let, const, class, super, import, export, yield etc.



ii)Can we use keywords as variable names?

❌ No!

*Keywords are reserved by JS.

*Using them as variable names will throw a syntax error.

Example:

var let = 10;    // ❌ SyntaxError
var for = 20;    // ❌ SyntaxError
var myVar = 30;  // ✅ Correct



iii)Key Rules for JS Variable Names

*Can contain letters, digits, _, $

*Cannot start with a digit

*Cannot use reserved keywords

*Case-sensitive (myVar ≠ MyVar)



4.=> Declaration Phase (Memory Creation)


i)What happens in the declaration phase?

*JS engine creates memory space for variables and functions before executing code.

*Variables declared with var are initialized with undefined, let and const are not initialized yet.

*Functions are fully stored in memory and can be called before their definition.

*JavaScript-ல் code run ஆகுமுன், engine variables மற்றும் functions-ஐ memory-ல் reserve பண்ணும் phase.

*இதையே Declaration Phase / Memory Creation Phase என்று சொல்லுறோம்.



ii)What happens in this phase?

Variables (var, let, const) are created in memory.

Functions (function myFunc(){}) are stored in memory.

Values are initialized differently depending on var/let/const.





ii)Explain hoisting with var and let.

Hoisting:

var → moved to top, value is undefined.

let/const → moved to top but cannot use before declaration (ReferenceError).

Example:

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 10;





5.=>Execution Phase

i)What happens in execution phase?

*In the execution phase, the JavaScript engine actually runs the code line by line.

*Variables are assigned values and functions are executed.

*Declaration phase: var a memory create aaguthu.

*Execution phase: a = 5 assign aaguthu, console.log run aaguthu.


ii)Difference between declaration and execution phase.


| Aspect      | Declaration Phase                                 | Execution Phase                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Memory allocate pannuthu variables & functions-ku | Code-a run pannuthu, values assign pannuthu, functions execute pannuthu |
| **When**    | Engine **hoists** declarations first              | **After hoisting**, code line by line execute aaguthu                   |
| **Example** | `var x; function foo(){}` memory create           | `x = 10; foo();` actual assignment & function call happens              |


*Declaration Phase: Memory prepare pannuthu, code run panna ready.

*Execution Phase: Code-a line by line run pannuthu, values assign pannuthu, functions execute pannuthu.







6.=> Naming Conventions

i)Explain Upper Case, Camel Case, Pascal Case, Snake Case with examples.


*Upper Case = CONSTANTS

*Camel Case = variable & function-First word small, next word capital. Variables & function-ku use pannuvom.

*Pascal Case = Class Name - Every word starts with capital letter. Mostly used for class names.

*Snake Case = underscores between words -Words separated by underscore _. Usually used in constants sometimes or old style. 






7.=>Using JS in Web Application

i)Difference between internal and external JS.

*Internal JavaScript;

Meaning: JS code is written inside the HTML file using <script> tag.


*External JavaScript

Meaning: JS code is in a separate .js file and HTML-le <script src="file.js"></script> use pannuvom.


| Feature         | Internal JS         | External JS               |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Location        | Inside HTML         | Separate `.js` file       |
| Reusability     | No                  | Yes, multiple pages       |
| Load Time       | Page load increases | Can cache, faster overall |
| Maintainability | Hard                | Easy                      |
| Best for        | Small scripts       | Big projects              |




i)Which is better for performance: internal or external?


✅ External JS is better

*Browser can cache external JS, reducing page load on next visit.

*Keeps HTML clean & maintainable.





8.=>Access Phase / Printing Statement

i)How to print values in JS?

JavaScript-la data or messages print panna 3 main ways irukku:

ii)Example: console.log(), alert(), document.write().

1. console.log()

Meaning: Browser console-la output show pannum.

Use: Debugging or checking values.

2. alert()

Meaning: Popup box-la message show pannum.

Use: User-ku immediate message kaamikka.

3. document.write()

Meaning: HTML page-le direct output add pannum.

Use: Simple testing, rarely use in real apps.






9.=>Let and Var without Initialization vs Const

i)Why let and var without value give undefined?

{var a;
let b;

console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b); // undefined}

Reason:

*Declaration phase-la memory create aaguthu.

*Execution phase-la value assign illa → default-a undefined assign aaguthu.


ii)Why const without initialization throws error?

Reason:

*const-ku value must be assigned immediately.

*const-la memory create panna value illa-na error throw aagum.






10.=> Execution Phase (Initialization Part)

i)Explain how variables get values during execution phase.

Example:

var a;      // Declaration Phase: memory created, a = undefined
a = 10;     // Execution Phase: value assigned
console.log(a); // 10


Explanation:

*Declaration Phase: var a; → memory reserved, value = undefined

*Execution Phase: a = 10; → memory-le value assign pannuthu



ii)Difference between memory allocation and assignment.

| Term              | Meaning                                             | Example                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Memory Allocation | JS engine **reserve space in memory** for variable  | `var x;` → memory reserved, value undefined |
| Assignment        | JS engine **store actual value** in reserved memory | `x = 5;` → memory-le 5 assign aaguthu       |


*Memory Allocation = memory ready

*Assignment = memory-le value store




11. Data Types

i)Name all primitive data types.

*Definition: Immutable, stored directly in stack memory.

*Primitive Types in JS:

*Number → 123, 3.14

*String → "Hello"

*Boolean → true / false

*Undefined → variable declared but no value

*Null → empty or intentionally no value

*BigInt → very large integers (9007199254740991n)

*Symbol → unique identifier

Tamil Shortcut:

*Primitive = small, direct value, stack memory-le store



ii)Name non-primitive data types.

*Definition: Stored in heap memory, variable stores reference/address of actual value.

Types:

*Object → {name: "Gowtham"}

*Array → [1,2,3]

*Function → function add(a,b){ return a+b }

*Date, RegExp, etc.

Tamil Shortcut:

*Reference Type = object/array/function, memory-le actual value store illa, variable only address store pannuthu.



iii)What is reference type?

*A variable that stores the address of the actual value in memory, not the value itself.

Tamil:

*Variable-ku value illa, value irukkura memory address store pannuthu.



iv)How reference type is stored?

let arr = [1,2,3];
arr → stack memory-le address store

[1,2,3] → heap memory-le actual array store

Tamil:

*Variable stack memory-le store, actual object/array function heap memory-le store aaguthu.


| Type      | Stored In               | Example                 |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Primitive | Stack                   | number, string, boolean |
| Reference | Heap (address in stack) | object, array, function |


*"Primitive types store actual value in stack, reference types store address in stack but actual value is in heap."


12. Array of Objects

i)Why typeof arrayOfObjects is object?

*In JavaScript, arrays are built on top of objects.
*So when you use typeof on an array or array of objects, JavaScript returns:

typeof []        // "object"
typeof [{}, {}]  // "object"


*Because internally, an array is just a special kind of object.

Tamil:

*JavaScript-la array itself object-oda special type.
So typeof array na JS always "object" return pannum.



ii)How to check if a variable is an array?

*Array.isArray(variable)


let arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(Array.isArray(arr)); // true



English:

*Safest and recommended way to check if something is an array.

Tamil:

*Ithu than best method — correct-a array ah nu check pannum.





13. JS Data Structures

i)What is an array? Give example.?

*An array is a list of values stored in a single variable.
Values can be numbers, strings, objects, or mixed.

*Example:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];



ii)What is an object? Example.

*An object stores data in key–value pairs.

*Example:
let user = {
  name: "Gowtham",
  age: 25,
  city: "Chennai"
};


iii)What is an array of objects? Example.

*An array that contains multiple objects.
Used to store a list of structured records.

(Example: student list, product list, etc.)

*Example:
let students = [
  { name: "Gowtham", age: 25 },
  { name: "Arun", age: 22 },
  { name: "Divya", age: 23 }
];



iv)What is a function? Example.

*A function is a block of code that performs a task and can be reused.

*function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
greet();



*Array: "Array is a list of values."

*Object: "Object stores data in key–value pairs."

*Array of Objects: "Array containing multiple objects."

*Function: "Function is reusable code that performs a task."




14. Operators

i)Name different types of operators in JS.

*Arithmetic Operators

*Comparison (Relational) Operators

*Logical Operators

*Assignment Operators

*Unary Operators

*Ternary (Conditional) Operator

*String Operators (optional for interview)

*Bitwise Operators (rarely asked)



i)Arithmetic: “Math operations (+, -, *, /).”

ii)Comparison: “Compare two values (==, ===, >).”

iii)Logical: “Combine conditions (&&, ||, !).”

iv)Assignment: “Assign or update values (=, +=).”

v)Unary: “Single value operators (++ , --, typeof).”

vi)Ternary: “Short if-else (condition ? value1 : value2).”

vii)Give example of arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment, unary, ternary operators.





15. ES6 Operators (Spread & Rest)

i)Difference between spread and rest operators.

*Spread → Expands values

*Rest → Collects values


ii)Give example of spread operator with array.

*Used to expand array elements.
Tamil: Array-oda values-a velila spread pannum.
Example:
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];

console.log(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

iii)Give example of rest operator with function parameters.

*Used to collect multiple arguments into an array.
Tamil: Function-ku varra extra values ellam orae array-la collect pannum.
Example:
function add(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
}

console.log(add(10, 20, 30)); // 60
