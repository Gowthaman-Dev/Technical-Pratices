Explain Hoisting

Definition:
Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the memory creation phase, before code execution.

*JavaScript runs code in two phases:

i)Memory Creation Phase – declarations are stored in memory

ii)Execution Phase – code is executed line by line


*Key Points to Remember

i)Hoisting happens during the memory phase

ii)var → hoisted and initialized as undefined

iii)let / const → hoisted but in TDZ

iv)Function declarations → fully hoisted

v)Function expressions → not fully hoisted
